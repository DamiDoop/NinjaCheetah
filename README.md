### howdy!
**I'm NinjaCheetah.** It's been a long time but I stil don't really know what I should put here because I'm bad at talking about myself. Basically, I'm an ameteur developer who hasn't quite nailed down a language to really focus on. Throughout the years, I've done a bit of Visual Basic, C#, C, Python, Swift, Rust, HTML/CSS/JS, Batch Scripting, Bash Scripting, and now some Kotlin. I notoriously don't finish things, so if it hasn't recieved work recently, its future is probably pretty uncertain, though I would love to work on a lot of my abandoned projects more.

Currently my focus is on [libWiiPy](https://github.com/NinjaCheetah/libWiiPy), which means I'm back to Python!
